# Musync - Next.js Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### ðŸ†• 2025-09-01 - Recent UI/UX Improvements

#### **Persistent Premium Plan Selection** (`components/PricingSection.tsx`)
- **Page refresh**: Always defaults to "premium" plan on component mount
- **Screen resize**: Resets to "premium" when window size changes (any device)
- **Scroll behavior**: Added ScrollTrigger to reset to "premium" when section comes into view or returns
- **Consistent UX**: Users can interact during viewing, but selection resets to premium on any navigation away and back
- Ensures premium plan is always highlighted as the recommended option

#### **Enhanced Mobile Navigation** (`components/NavBar.tsx`)
- Increased all mobile navigation links by 30% (`text-sm` â†’ `text-lg`: 14px â†’ 18px)
- Enhanced dropdown arrows by 25% (`h-2 w-2` â†’ `h-[10px] w-[10px]`: 8px â†’ 10px)
- Added `isMobile` prop to Arrow component for conditional sizing
- Improved mobile accessibility with larger, easier-to-tap navigation elements

#### **Compacted "Why Musync" Tiles** (`components/WhySection.tsx`)
- Removed fixed `min-h-[330px]` height constraint for content-adjusted sizing
- Reduced padding from `p-5` to `p-4 pb-20` and tightened spacing (`mb-4` â†’ `mb-3`)
- Smaller text size (`text-sm`) with `leading-relaxed` for better readability
- Repositioned icons closer to content (`bottom-5 right-5` â†’ `bottom-3 right-3`)
- **Result**: More efficient use of space while maintaining visual appeal

#### **Improved Mobile Animation Performance** (`components/AnimatedSection.tsx`)
- Added mobile device detection utility (`isMobile()`) based on screen width and user agent
- **Desktop animations**: Faster scrub response (1.3 â†’ 0.6) for more responsive scroll-stop behavior
- **Mobile animations**: Slower, smoother animations - increased scrub to 2.5, path durations by 80%, and fade-ins by 67%
- Enhanced mobile experience with performance-optimized, less demanding animations

#### **Optimized App Store Buttons Layout** (`components/Hero.tsx`)
- Changed mobile layout from vertical (`flex-col`) to horizontal (`flex-row`) stacking
- Increased button size by 40% (width: 144px â†’ 208px) and height by 50% (62px â†’ 93px)
- Added vertical centering with `transform="translate(0, 15.5)"` for SVG content within taller containers
- Improved mobile user experience with larger, side-by-side download buttons

#### **Enhanced Pricing Section Icons** (`public/check-icon.svg` & `public/uncheck-icon.svg`)
- **Check icons**: Changed to bright green (#22C55E background, #16A34A checkmark) with circle stroke for positive indication
- **Uncheck icons**: Changed to brown (#543f3a) with 80% opacity for subtle but visible negative indication
- Improved accessibility and visual hierarchy between included vs excluded features
